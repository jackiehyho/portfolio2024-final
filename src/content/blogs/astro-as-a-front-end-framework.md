## What is Astro?
Astro is a web framework that allows you to create content-rich web experiences. It pioneered and popularized a front-end architecture called islands. Islands architecture organizes application code into small self-contained modules based on features or parts of the application. It also by default strips away all the initial JavaScript that may slow a page load and reintroduces it later to allow the web experience to be lightning fast and search engine friendly.
