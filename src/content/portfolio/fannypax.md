# Project Summary


## Market Validations
- “Letting a complete stranger tag along in your group because you assumed someone in your group knew him/her”
- “That people don't want to make decisions, so someone else makes it for them and then they are unhappy that it's not like they thought it would be”
- “Getting everyone to meet up at the specified time”
- "I've never travelled with a big group before but I can imagine it would be frustrating if everyone wanted to do different things at the destination place."
