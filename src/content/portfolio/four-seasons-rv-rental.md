introduction: ["Four Seasons RV Rentals is a RV rental division of Fraserway RV with various rental depots across Canada. This website serves as an informational website where they can showcase their rv rental products and service offerings for prospective RV renters.","The original website had outlived it's product lifecycle and needed a refresh in both updating the platform and modernizing the code.", "This project served as an opportunity to push my creativity and skills, rework the brand and modernize the platform to better serve RV rental customers."]
objectives: ["To modernized the brand and web experiences of Four Seasons RV Rental for both staff and customers so customers can make an informed decision before they book an RV."]
productVision: "To provide a seamless booking experience for RV renters."
impact: [{header: "10%⬆", subheader: "in User Growth YoY", description: "Visitors from all over the world have visited and browsed the website before going through the booking engine."}, {header: "20%⬆", subheader: "in Site Performance", description: "Mobile first development and increases across the board in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices & SEO based on lighthouse performance reports."}, {header: "500%⬆", subheader: "in Staff Productivity", description: "Successfully re-platformed to WordPress enabling others to update content and removing the need to manually update through FTP."}]
problems: ["Not mobile responsive","Required FTP access to update content", "No existing analytics","Brand is being consolidated"]
goals: ["To unify the Four Seasons RV Rental brand closer to Fraseway RV.", "To provide a modern mobile-friendly experience for customers.", "To implement a content management system to increase productivity for staff.", "To add in analytics via GTM and Google Universal Analytics." ]
challenges: ["The primary challenge for this product was time and resources. In addition to the product needing to be completed before the start of the camping season. We were also tasked to consolidate the brand closer to Fraserway RV.","Since this product was being created in-house with very little budget, the team huddled and came up with the following solution."]
solutions: ["Our first task was to identify the brand positioning that we wanted to take with Four Seasons. The decision was to remove the economy portion and introduce the tie in the Fraserway instead. We then took a look at the logo to see how we may take elements from the Fraserway logo to help bring it closer to Fraserway's logo.", "The department wanted the brand to capture the fun atmosphere of renting RVs and the rental department, so I created 3 different art directions to help visualize the look. We ultimately went with the current brand elements of faceless vector art to allow the style to be flexible and have it juxtaposed it with real RV images. We took apart the design inside adobe cc library and created a design system to quickly compose new designs.","For the website, we opted to purchase a starter theme to reduce development time and modified it with some custom development. To satisfy specific business requirements, we used plug-in combinations such as custom post type and advanced custom fields to create custom data fields to make it easier for staff to populate the content."]
results: ["Overall the website was considered a success and was launched on time. The art direction was well-recieved and additional assets such as tire covers, physical signage continue to be utilized and expanded by the rental department today."]

## DISCOVERY
### Interviewing Internal Subject Matter Experts

Some example questions that we asked were the following:
- What are rental customers looking for when booking an RV?
- What does rental operations need to help generate revenue?
- What are the KPIs we are using to determine success?

One of our subject matter experts has been part of the rental division since its inception and the interview process gave us a lot of insights and information about rental customers and their behaviours. 

### CHALLENGES
- No web analytics 
- Booking System on a separate platform


### PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Four Seasons RV Rentals looks different than Fraserway RV
- How do we make it more accessible to other internal staff


### Interviewing Subject Matter Experts
We interviewed our subject matter experts to try and figure out what was important for their customers.

Some example questions that we asked were the following:
- What are rental customers looking for when booking an RV?
- What does rental operations need to help generate revenue?
- What are the KPIs we are using to determine success?

One of our subject matter experts has been part of the rental division since its inception and the interview process gave us a lot of insights and information about rental customers and their behaviours. 

### Understanding the Competition
From our interview, we identified the competition and performed a competitor analysis to better understand what the competition is doing for their customers. 

Some example questions that our team had asked were the following:
- What information does our competitors have that we can easily put in place. 
- What features does our competitors have that we currently do not.
- What services do we currently offer that we aren't telling our customers.

These types of questions help us identify, how we can differentiate against our competitors.

### Identifying the Platform
Updating the content manually through a code editor was not sustainable as it was built with PHP. This made it technically difficult for other team members to update the website with new offers or content. We decided on a platform that the department was familiar with so it can be easily updated by everyone else.

### Information Architecture
The content of the old website was copied and analyzed to help identify themes. We also reviewed our notes from the interview to ensure that key elements noted by the subject matter experts are taken into consideration at this stage.

We defined each category and then prioritized the content balancing business goals and user needs. 

### User Flow
A user flow diagram was then created to help guide users through what was required to make a booking request.

## 02 SYNTHESIZING A SOLUTION
After reviewing all of our notes, we synthesized the research to prescribed a solution for the department.

### Lo & Hi-fidelity Mockups
A lo-fidelity diagram was created in sketch to help guide users through what was required to make a booking request. A Hi-fidelity prototype was also created to help the rental department visualize the art direction and conceptual website.

## 03 EXECUTION
Once the concept had been approved, we created UI mockups on key template pages only for approval due to timeline and resource availability.

### Staging the website
A staging site was provided by IT to facilitate testing and provide a space for us to make our updates.

### Producing Design Assets
After creating the rest of the mockups, we extracted a list of images and sizes to be produced by our designer.

## 04 APPROVALS & FINAL REVISIONS 
We sat down with the rental department to go through the new website page by page as well as give them the opportunity to further explore after the presentation. 

### Setting Up Google Tag Manager for Analytics and Event Tracking
Google tag manager was placed with Universal Analytics and event tracking KPIs into analytics. 

## 05 RESULT
The website replatform was deem a success and the art direction provided by me was received favouribly by the VP of Rentals. Overall bookings and traffic have also increased as a result. -->
