# Case Study Summary
The client approached me in need of a logo for his landscaping business. A visual identity package was created for Bredy Landscaping that included logos, fonts, colours, hats, uniforms and vehicle decals. The project was a success and the client is happy with what he had received.

## 01 DISCOVERY

### Pinterest
Pinterest is a great place to see lots of logos in one space. I created a board to save the logos that resonated with the client so I can use that as reference later when I design their conceptual logos. We went through each one that they had saved and had them tell me why they liked it so I can note it down.

I really enjoyed using this process as it involved the client to be collaborative with the work so it adds a sense of ownership when we co-design.

### Client Interview

Example questions that I would ask to gain more insight. 
- What are you using the logos for this project?
- What are some words that best describe the logo that you're looking for?
- What type of clients are you trying to attract for your business?

It is important to find a balance between business needs, customer perception and client preferences for an identity to empower the business. 

## 02 EXECUTION

### Concept Logos

Using the pinterest board as reference, I categorized the reference logos into logo styles. From there, I used the notes that I took on their preferences and created a variety of logo styles in my sketch book before translating into illustrator

I also like to visualize the logos in both light and dark applications to ensure that there's enough contrast in different contextual applications.

### Meeting with the Client
I reduced down the logo selection and presented the client with 5 choices and allowed them to pick the one that resonated with them the best. He selected the one that is currently in use and it needed no additional refinement.
